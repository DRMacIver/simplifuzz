# Simplifuzz

Simplifuzz is a new breed of fuzzer that works off a notion of 'label'. A label
is e.g. an AFL coverage target.

Simplifuzz attempts to produce a minimal element reaching each label. This
turns out to provide quite an impressive corpus.

This is all a work in progress. You may wish to ignore this repo for now.
